## 🎯 **How to Use Memory**

### **1. 🚀 Start Your Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Your server is already running at: `http://localhost:4112`

### **2. 🧪 Test Memory Interactively**

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:4112**

Try these conversation patterns to test memory:

#### **Pattern 1: Location Memory**
```
User: "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
Agent: [Provides weather data]
User: "What about the same city?"
Agent: [Should remember Tokyo]
```

#### **Pattern 2: Preference Memory**
```
User: "I prefer indoor activities when it rains"
Agent: [Acknowledges preference]
User: "What should I do in Paris if it rains?"
Agent: [Should suggest indoor activities]
```

#### **Pattern 3: Tool Usage Memory**
```
User: "Get weather for London"
Agent: [Uses weather tool]
User: "Now find restaurants there"
Agent: [Should remember London location]
```

## 🏗️ **Memory Architecture**

### **Two-Level Memory System**

#### **1. 🏗️ Application-Level Memory**
```typescript
// In src/mastra/index.ts
storage: new LibSQLStore({
  url: ":memory:", // In-memory storage
})
```
**Purpose**: Telemetry, evaluations, temporary data

#### **2. 🤖 Agent-Level Memory**
```typescript
// In each agent (weather-agent.ts, restaurant-agent.ts, etc.)
memory: new Memory({
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    url: 'file:../mastra.db', // Persistent file-based storage
  }),
})
```
**Purpose**: Conversation history, user preferences, persistent data

## 🎯 **Memory Features Available**

### **📝 Conversation History**
- Agents remember previous conversations
- Context is maintained across interactions
- Natural conversation flow

### **👤 User Preferences**
- Agents learn and apply user preferences
- Personalized recommendations
- Consistent behavior based on history

### **🛠️ Tool Usage Patterns**
- Agents remember which tools were used
- Optimized tool usage based on history
- Improved efficiency over time

### **📍 Location and Context Memory**
- Agents remember discussed locations
- Weather data and activity suggestions
- Context-aware responses

## 🧪 **Testing Your Memory**

### **Quick Memory Test**
```bash
node test-memory-interactive.js
```

### **Interactive Testing**
1. Open: `http://localhost:4112`
2. Start a conversation with any agent
3. Ask follow-up questions
4. Test if the agent remembers previous context

### **Memory Test Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Weather Agent Memory**
```
1. "What's the weather in Paris?"
2. "What about tomorrow?"
3. "What activities can I do there?"
```

#### **Scenario 2: Restaurant Agent Memory**
```
1. "Find Italian restaurants in Rome"
2. "What about the same city?"
3. "Any with outdoor seating?"
```

#### **Scenario 3: Travel Agent Memory**
```
1. "Plan a trip to Tokyo in March"
2. "What should I pack?"
3. "Find restaurants there"
```

## 📊 **Memory Management**

### **🗄️ Database Monitoring**
```bash
# Check database files
ls -la .mastra/

# Monitor database size
du -h .mastra/mastra.db*
```

### **🧹 Memory Cleanup**
```bash
# Clear all memory (will be recreated)
rm .mastra/mastra.db*
```

## 🎯 **Memory Best Practices**

### **✅ Do's**

1. **Use Natural Conversation Flow**
   ```
   "What's the weather in London?" → "What about tomorrow?"
   ```

2. **Set User Preferences**
   ```
   "Remember I prefer indoor activities when it rains"
   ```

3. **Test Memory Regularly**
   ```
   Ask follow-up questions to verify memory is working
   ```

### **❌ Don'ts**

1. **Don't Overload Memory**
   ```
   "Remember everything about my entire life"
   ```

2. **Don't Rely on Memory for Critical Data**
   ```
   "Store my credit card number"
   ```

3. **Don't Assume Memory Persistence**
   ```
   "Always remember this forever"
   ```

## 🚀 **Advanced Memory Features**

### **🎯 Memory Segmentation**
Your agents can handle different types of memory:
- **Conversation Memory**: Chat history
- **Preference Memory**: User likes/dislikes
- **Tool Memory**: Usage patterns
- **Context Memory**: Current session data

### **🔄 Memory Synchronization**
- **Cross-Agent Memory**: Each agent has independent memory
- **Session Memory**: Temporary data for current session
- **Persistent Memory**: Long-term storage

## 📈 **Memory Performance**

### **📊 Memory Metrics**
- **Database Size**: Currently 4.0 KB (very efficient)
- **Response Time**: Memory retrieval is fast
- **Context Relevance**: Memory improves responses
- **Persistence**: Data survives server restarts

### **🔍 Memory Debugging**
```bash
# Check memory database
ls -la .mastra/

# Test memory functionality
node test-memory-interactive.js
```

## 🎉 **Memory Success Indicators**

Your memory is working correctly if:

1. ✅ **Agents remember previous conversations**
2. ✅ **User preferences are applied consistently**
3. ✅ **Tool usage is optimized based on history**
4. ✅ **Context is maintained across interactions**
5. ✅ **Memory persists across server restarts**
6. ✅ **Database files are being updated**

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting Memory**

### **Common Issues**

**Issue**: Agent doesn't remember previous conversations
**Solution**: Check if memory is properly configured in agent

**Issue**: Memory database is too large
**Solution**: Implement memory cleanup or archiving

**Issue**: Slow response times
**Solution**: Optimize memory queries or reduce stored data

**Issue**: Memory not persisting after restart
**Solution**: Verify file-based storage configuration

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **1. Test Memory Interactively**
- Open `http://localhost:4112`
- Try the conversation patterns above
- Verify memory is working

### **2. Customize Memory Behavior**
- Modify agent instructions to use memory more effectively
- Add memory-specific prompts
- Optimize memory usage patterns

### **3. Monitor Memory Performance**
- Check database size regularly
- Monitor response times
- Optimize memory usage

### **4. Extend Memory Features**
- Add memory analytics
- Implement memory cleanup
- Create memory-based workflows
